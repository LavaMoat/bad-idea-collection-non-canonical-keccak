package named "keccak", but with content differing from the npm registry's canonical "keccak"

for demonstration purposes only

this is not part of the [`bad-idea-collection`](https://github.com/lavamoat/bad-idea-collection) monorepo because it is installed as a git dependency, and therefore needs to be defined at the root of the repo.

### usage

installed via [`@bad-idea/non-canonical-keccak-parent`](https://github.com/LavaMoat/bad-idea-collection/tree/master/packages/non-canonical-keccak-parent)
